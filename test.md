    ## Context for Next Session: December 22nd, 2022, Onward

The analysis of November 27th, 2022, to December 21st, 2022, revealed a continuation of the low trust environment between Dimitar and Vanja. Dimitar's move to Australia has slightly reduced tension, but his dismissive communication style persists, albeit without "joky banter." Vanja continues to exhibit a passive approach, rarely addressing Dimitar's disrespect directly.

**Key Observations:**

* **Dimitar:** Continues to mock Vanja and dismiss his perspectives despite claiming to have removed "joky banter" from their interactions. 
* **Vanja:**  Remains passive in the face of Dimitar's disrespect, opting for weak counter-insults or indirect communication instead of direct confrontation.
* **Trust:**  No overt discussions of trust take place, and the underlying dynamics continue to suggest a low trust environment. 

**Areas to Track:**

* **Impact of Physical Distance:** Does the physical distance lead to more respectful communication or does Dimitar's dismissiveness persist? Does Vanja become more assertive in Dimitar's absence?
* **Shifts in Communication Patterns:**  Are there any noticeable changes in their communication styles as Dimitar settles into his new life in Australia? 
* **Emergence of New Topics:**  With Dimitar's life changes, do new topics and shared interests emerge that could potentially foster more positive interactions? 
* **Potential for Trust Repair:**  Are there any instances where Dimitar demonstrates genuine curiosity or empathy towards Vanja?  Does Vanja make any attempts to directly address the power imbalance or set clear boundaries? 

Pay close attention to how their communication evolves in this new phase of their relationship. The upcoming interactions may reveal whether the physical distance can create an opportunity for positive change or if their ingrained patterns will continue to hinder trust development.

    in this section I want you to focus on: collect a running tally on values & beliefs for each person. look for clashes and conflicts. also focus on contentious political scissor beliefs (eg trump, feminism, etc) and highlight stated beliefs, tracking as they change, 
        but also evaluate what you think their actual beliefs are and if theyr ebeing honest. use this to think about impact on trust in the debates and discussions
     

n trying to get music theory answers out of it, sometimes im not sure if its lying or making mistakes tho which confused me even more 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: ive caught it changing its mind 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: I dont have a guitar to test this out but it seems legit 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: lol 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: I'm somehow in a situation where I need to submit a timesheet, but I'm also the person who approves my timesheet 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: so when am I sorting out a job for you? 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: who knows, earlier this week I was thinking how I need to be jobless later this year 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: been thinking a bit about start ups 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: GROSS 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: why would you want startups 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: consulting is where its at i hear 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: looks like google has some sort of docker container without the kitchensink thing that iâve been thinking about https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: because i want to 10x 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: circumnavigate the corporate hierarchy to make some real money 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: sounds like a lot of effort 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: anyway, theres a startup here that I can put you in touch with that are pretty good 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: thatâs cool, worth checking out 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: not exactly looking to move to perth though 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: You can work from wherever 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: what do they do 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: [censored url] 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: like topcoder but au? 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: Going to meet with their cto now 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: I think theyâre doing a lot of work for the US rn actually 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: australia might be a good place to outsource to, although maybe not with the timezone 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: i have no mental model for what the talent is like in australia 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: I think itâs better than the US 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: But only because the best coders in the US get pushed into management 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: yeah idk, i was thinking more in terms of quantity and type 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: I think thereâs at least 20-30 here 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: And theyâre of type programmer 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: yeah Iâve been thinking a little more about types of programmers 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: and types of skill levels in those categories 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: mostly because of the start up thing, and just general categorising. wondering who to connect with and how 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: we used to talk about archetypes at fb 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: Code machine, prototyper, organizer etc 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: thats kinda interesting 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: whats a code machine vs prototyper 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: Code machine just builds the thing, write a mountain of code really quickly 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: Prototyper is go understand the new thing 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: ah right 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: what others? 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: I canât remember, there were like 5 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: i constantly think about the category which is âdealing with mountain of complexity that is caused by corporate retardationâ 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: and whether iâm in a ârealâ challenging position 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: or if i need to move to something more data orientated 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: but then i see those guys work and theyre basically the same, only a little bit of work is âok lets use a dictionary here instead of a treeâ 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: there are some that seem to do correctness, which is interesting 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: but then those are skills very valuable in super big co (and even there, debateably) 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: and then i wonder if its worth just pivoting to the âcodes fast using latest tech and concise codeâ type 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: How to decide? 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: Iâve just found myself naturally gravitate to the next thing 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: But I think thatâs what Tpm letâs you do 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: next thing? 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: Yeah the next career step 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: in what way is it special for tpms? 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: Idk if itâs special 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: But basically you just got to look at all the problems and pick what you thought was high impact 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: ah yeah, i think all roles have that if they play it right 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: Yeah likely 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: i feel like ive got my post-covid work intensity back. now im at âi should probably find something valuable to effort into' 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: Like at Amazon I saw a bunch of analysis issues, so I just dove in and understood data, which lead to clickstream 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: Then I was doing platform type shit because that was the big interesting problem and that lead to Amazon api 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: That turned into business/tech interface and that lead to fb etc 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: read an article the other day that talked about getting stuck in the upper middle class trap 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: where comfort leads to complacency 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: and working hard getting slow promos leads to big picture minor improvements 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: i guess thereâs the possibility of âmaking itâ and going up the ranks to director and VP 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: Yeah I think itâs kinda like savings vs debt 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: Changing jobs/roles is like using debt to work for you 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: Staying in one place is like accumulating savings 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: Both have pros and cons 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: yeah getting cozy is nice 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: I think about my pe friend at Amazon 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: Spent 7 years at Amazon, now has multiple 800k+ offers 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: 7 years total or as PE? 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: Total 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: 800+ offers is a bit of an outlier according to levels.fyi 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: and like 800 is a lot, its good 
[2023-01-13] Dimitar: Heâs god tier 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: that puts him above l7 ic, so like an l8, but an l8 director seems to make like 1m 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: i guess at 1m its good 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: but im still thinking about the start up angle 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: and then I balance it against my music interestsâ¦ maybe my music is my start up 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: lots of these start up things basically talk about how an artist/band is basically a start up 
[2023-01-13] Vanja: i guess companies are incentivised to poach away people that have been at competitors for a long time, to destabilize 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: [censored url] 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: Chat GPT, rewrite the following anti-conservative essay using the mirror strategy. For example, rewrite paragram 4 to 6 as:

Liberalism consists of exactly one proposition: [censored]. Nothing more, nothing else, in any place or time. 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Haha, what did it come up with? 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: i didnt try, it would reject anything to do with [censored] 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: vscode copilot has âbrushesâ now, you can paint a section of code with a brush and then use text to describe it 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: eg ârewrite this ternary into more readable codeâ 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: âwrite a unit test for this" 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Damn 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Shit is moving quickly 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: why are you sending me political rage bait 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: arent you supposed to be above politics now that youâre in australia 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Thatâs a strange thing to say 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Why would I be above politics now that Iâm in Australia? 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: I thought it was an interesting take id never heard before 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: The idea that conservatism boils down to:

âThere must be in-groups whom the law protectes but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.â 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: And the basically, everything that has sprung up after - liberalism, progressivism, etc - is garbage: 

âNo, it aânât. The task is to throw all those things on the exact same burn pile as the collected works of all the apologists for conservatism, and start fresh.â 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: thought you said before you were looking fwd to getting back to australia so you can get away from the political treadmill 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Yeah? 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Not sure how being tired of talking/seeing/hearing about politics 24/7 translates to âIâm above politics nowâ 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Kinda a backhanded comment to make towards someone expressing fatigue over a thing really 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: not sure why you take it as backhand, you made it sound like you were exiting politics discussion and excited about it 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: NEVER GET OFF THE TREADMILL OR ILL IMPLY YOURE ELITIST 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: i guess i misunderstood, no ones implying that youâre elitist or idk what youâve inferred here 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: anyway, on the topic of âconservatism and liberlism are just ingroup/outgroup" 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: it higlights an interesting point, but then mashes it through the lense of âfuck those guysâ so hard that it distracts from the interesting point 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: which is ironic actually 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: there is now âthe tolerant peopleâ, who are tolerant of everything, except intolerance 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: I donât think it distracts at all 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Heâs saying 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: His hypothesis is Conservatism at its core is about preferncing the in group 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: And heâs like, thats bad, but also the other political ideas that have come out are also garbage 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: When really all we need is to apply the rules equally to in group and out group and do away with preferential treatment 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: His statement of âduck those guysâ applies equally to all the political ideologies 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: That resonates with me 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: This bit 

âThen the appearance arises that the task is to map âliberalismâ, or âprogressivismâ, or âsocialismâ, or whateverthefuckkindofstupidnoise-ism, onto the core proposition of anti-conservatism.â 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: This explains how you canât point out the bits where conservatism sucks and try and make improvements without being labeled some kind of leftie 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: When really itâs like, maybe the rules people came up with 200, 500, 1000 years ago donât really apply that well today 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: Yeah the quoted text is a bit tricky to read on its own because heâs redefining conservatism and liberism for his argument, so now its vague if heâs saying âconservatives play ingroup/outgroup, unlike us tolerant liberalsâ or hes trying to say âthe tolerant liberals are actually playing ingroup/outgroup just like the conservatives, but using a different name" 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: from the way he was quietly shifting labels around + using strong judgement + assuming hes talking about america and not acknowledging that american law very much tries to take people equally, i assumed this text was trying to say the âunlike us tolerant liberalsâ thing 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: if hes trying to say the 2nd thing, then yeah I agree. its ingroup/outgroup all the way with just different boundaries on in/out 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Redefining? 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Who owns the definition of conservatism today? 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: i dont agree that conservatism = ingroup/outgroup. one day there will be an ideology that is not ingroup/outgroup, it will be dominant, it will be taken on by a challenger, and someone will try conserve that non-ingroupoutgroup ideology and it will be considered conservatism. conservatism is about conserving what is and exists 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Or liberalism? 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Conserving what exists based on what timeline? 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: well, he put out a novel definition and said âconservatism boils down to ingroup outgroupâ. idk who made him an authority on that statement 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Doesnât that mean we should all be trying to live in caves and huts? 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: i know neither of us thought of conservatism as that 20 minutes ago 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: no, because it doesnt mean rolling back 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: So it means only preserve the things conservatism failed to conserve? 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Or didnât fail to conserve? 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: what does? 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Conservatism 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: conservatism means only perserve teh things conservatism failed to conserve or didnt fail to conserve? 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: idk what that means 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Trying to parse the statement of conserving what is and exists 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: And Iâm like, so why arenât conservatives still in caves? 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: because theyre not trying to roll back 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Or demanding that men still wear makeup and wigs? 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: theyre resisting change 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: conserving what is 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Right, so they only resist change on the stuff that they havenât failed to resist change on yet 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: stuff they havent accepted yet, sure i guess 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: So itâs some arbitrary set of things? 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Or is there a set of things that conservatism really wants to hold onto and is actually trying to roll back v 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: depends on your definition of conservatism now, how american centric do you want to be? Conservatives in different countries are trying to preserve different things 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Well I wouldnât want to try and redefine conservatism 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: I thought you knew since you said that guy was redefining it? 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Surely if youâre labeling something as being redefined you know the definition no? 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: was that your definition of conservatism before you read that article? 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: i have a definition, i think its pretty spot on 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: undefined 
[2023-01-15] Vanja: undefined 
[2023-01-15] Dimitar: Soz people rocked up 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: [censored url] 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: remember this guy 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: migjt be time to visit ecuador 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: for a brief stint of time it might be safe 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: interesting.. https://simplifyrecipe.com/shortcut 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: I use an app for this called paprika 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: Itâs paid but really good 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: Yeah better go before those guys get let out 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: I donât really read recipes, I meant the use case of an iOS shortcut app that houses what I assume is a chatgpt tool for summarising. Apparently its good enough that the guy is growing it into an app 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: Yeah paprika does the same thing and I donât think it uses chatgpt 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: The output seems pretty identical 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: Sebastian started doing this thing where if you stick your tongue out at him he copies you now 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: Apparently this month his brain gets the ability to understand the relationships between things 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: relationships between things? 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: Like this is next to that 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: This thing is on top of that thing 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: That thing is near/far 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: You may have noticed that Sebastian realizes that you can increase the distance between the two of you.
This (perception of distances changing between you) causes most babies to "panic" around 29 weeks of age. With this leap, Sebastian will learn to understand short tasks, notice details, and he will like anything that is action-reaction related (such as light switches). 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: lol 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: just read a thing by a guy saying he found he could get his toddler to complain less about lights out time by exploiting backwards rationalization. he asked him to turn off the light switch and that made him go âok lights out is a good thing because I did itâ 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: relearnign the world ground up 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: âthings are caused by other things" 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: so much stuff you just take for granted 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: yeah thats the advice, the way you get toddlers to do things is to make them feel like they're making decisions 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: so if they're resisting bathtime you ask "do you want to hop or sneak to bath time?" 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: yea was an interesting article actually, apparently his kid eventually realised the bs A or B trick and got annoyed 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: its a program language where the computer starts fighting you if you dont evolve the commands 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: this is probably the first gen that programmers will be raising kids in bulk 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: i wonder how programmer kids will compare to non programmer kids 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: probably doesnt help that programmer people are generally socially retarded 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: but i wonder if the way of looking at things changes things 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: i guess math and science people always existed, as did the opposite 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: yeah, I dont think it will change a lot 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: but 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: the tightrope of exposing your kid to software thats trying to hack their dopamine but also make sure they're not left behind is an interesting one 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: its cray how effective it is 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: my brothers kids play roblox on the ipad, its basically like next level minecraft where people can make games in it 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: and they were playing a game where the objective was to tap the screen to build a tower 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: and it would give you points 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: and then after a certain number of points, you could break your tower to upgrade the amount of tower levels it builds per tap 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: and so they're literally just sitting there tapping the screen on this endless cycle that has no other payoff other than imaginary points 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: and they're not really equipped enough to rationalize whats happening 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: I ask them questions and they're kinda just like, well this is fun 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: kinda feels like this is what social media is for adults 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: yea weâve all got our dopamine loops, pseudo cigarettes, probably easier to notice on kids than adults 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: although ive also heard some talk about how its a small part of their development. eg lightswitches, to adults, are nothing, but if you have no concept of causality you might play with it for hours until your brain âgets itâ 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: of course theres still the playing with it too long thing 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: like we played video games, to our parents that probably looked like a huge waste 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: sure but when we were in the prime development period 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: if everykid gets sucked into roblox, maybe thats how theyll bind? 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: video games we'rent built to dopaine hack you 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: sure, they were less dopamine dangerous, but light years more dangerous than table top games or hitting things with a stick 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: dangerous? 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: efficient? 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: dopamine intense 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: right 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: effective 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: for example, i think about cs, and competing/grinding kills 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: and wow, grinding 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: yeah but thats not all they did 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: did that teach me how to grind dopamine? 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: CS, team work and strategy 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: WoW, story telling, teamwork, and social skills 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: like, could you have become as intense at dopamine grinding if not for the easy video game on ramp 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: yeah also true 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: what does roblox teach 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: tapping on a screen to make a tower, yeah, grinding and dopamine, not much else 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: to me its interesting that its open world 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: tehre are other games in roblox that have more utility than that 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: maybe theyll work their way up 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: but its difficult to compete with the tower game 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: how long have they been on it 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: nah they started on those games 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: a couple of years at least 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: maybe 2 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: of tapping the tower? 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: oh, idk, like a week or two 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: but they started on games that were like 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: navigate this crazy platformer with puzzles 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: and I was amazed 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: and now every other game is some version of tap the screen for dopamine 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: yeah idk. i imagine they dont channel surf tv like we did 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: I never really did that 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: I mean I did, but we literally only had 2 channels until I was 12 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: and then we got 3 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: so channel surfing was a short exercise 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: ah right, what im trying to say is i feel like i wasted tonnes of time doing dumb stuff 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: and eventually i âboredâ out of addiction loops 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: yes, but a lot of that dumb stuff wasn't specifically engineered to take over part of your brain 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: where as a lot of the dumb stuff kids do today 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: is 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: because industry has learned this thing 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: maybe it wasnt specificslly engineered, but it had similar effects from dumb luck 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: now we engineer these games, but before that clueless people made games and some addictive ones got popular 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: sure, but thats like saying, well the sun and a nuclear warhead are pretty much the same thing 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: sun wasn't specifically engineered to kill people but it sure has killed a lot of them through dumb luck 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: (I'm proud of that analogy) 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: what are you trying to say with it? that its a matter of intensity? 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: because im trying to say the same thing 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: maybe like a microwave and nuclear bomb? both radiate you 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: that there are two different categories entirely here 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: and its not just a bigger scale of the thing we used to be exposed to when we were kids 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: its a targeted tool that creates a whole new set of challenges that we dont have any solutions for yet 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: yeah im saying its the same category (dopamine loop), its just with explicit design we made it better 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: like we had bridges before engineering 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: then we got engineering and better bridges 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: I mean, I would say bridges are engineering 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: but thats a side track 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: yeah so thats where we disagree 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: engineering is mathemaics and measuring and precise building of bridge 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: vs just putting things down and hoping that theyre fun and engaging 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: I'm pretty sure engineering is just using science to build shit 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: if you build a bridge and it falls over 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: and then you're like, oh, we need a thing here 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: and then it doesnt fall over 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: thats engineering 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: you can build a bridge by planning it out with measurements and load testing calculations, or you can just throw some shit down with the goal of a bridge and hope it sirvives 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: both bridges, one is just much better than the other 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: ok 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: what does that have to do with engineering? 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: forget engineering now 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: anyway, this is a side track 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: what I'm suggesting is that the way technology is used today, is very different to how it was used 25 years ago 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: im trying to say you can build something with a precise method for result, or build it clumsily without the preciseness, and the result can be the same just different intensity 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: and should be looked at differently 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: what is this relevant to? 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: the idea that new games or just more intense versions of old games and not categorically different 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: right yeah 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: so the sun vs a nuclear bomb 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: in some regards sure. they both produce energy. one is more intense than the other. one is engineered to produce energy and one just exists/was made to be vaguely fun 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: yeah, you can look at them categorically different, or you can treat them as distinct. Personally I think you get more value out of treating them as things in their own distinct categories 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: technically everything ever is in the same category of "exists in our universe in some form" 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: but its not really a useful way of reasoning about things 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: yes thats not useful as a category here, but i think of âacts as a dopamine loopâ as a good category of things that i use 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: I think thats over inclusive because you can put things in there like, "completing the stamp card from my coffee shop" 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: or "going for a run" 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: yes thats the intent 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: because once i identify a dopamine loop, the goal is to replace it with a different one 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: eg going for a run 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: (one that gives me benefits, as opposed to one that involves clicking on a box) 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: right, what I'm saying is thats one way to look at it 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: but if you say, these games that have been explicitly engineered to drive dopamine are their own thing 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: you can start to come up with ideas that help you evolve your thinking in that domain 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: in the sun/nuclear categorization example, i dont know how youâd caregorize these 4 scenarios or how it would be helpful:
1. high intensity dopamine activity that was engineered
2 low intensity dopamine activity not engineered
3 low intensity dopamien activity that was engineered
4 high intensity dopamine activity that wad not engineered 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: i naturally want to pair low and high dopamine activity, regardless of engineered or not 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: and i dont see what knowing it was engineered gives me, although thinking about how to counter act engineered dopamine activities is interesting 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: as a reverse engineering activity 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: but i woulf also put a nonengineered highly effective activity down the same reverse engineering pathway 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: yeah, good point, if you cant see what knowing it was engineered gives you then you shouldn't bother exploring it 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: makes sense 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: if you have a fixed mindset on a thing that is 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: i didnt say im not interested in exploring how dopamine hacks are engineered, im interested in that. i was asking about how this method of categorizing deals with the above scenarios 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: I have no idea 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: I'm most interested in exploring what these engineered dopamine activities do to a developing brain, and how do you trigger awareness in that developing brain around these activities without breaking the developing brain 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: yeah makes sense. im mostly interested in what people can do with high dopamine activities, engineered or not 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: i guess i now see why youre categorizing that way, and you see why im categorizing this way 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: yeah 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: [censored url] 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: lol 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: whatâs funny 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: I donât get what youâre saying with this? 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: I'm not saying anything 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: I just thought it was a curious thing 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: whatâs curious? whatâs funny? 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: the highlighted bit 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: that âmentally healthyâ men to overestimate to overestimate their capabilities? 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: if you're healthy, you think you can dunk 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: lol 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: yeah, thereâs benefits to being overconfident 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: its really interesting because I had this "I can really do anything I can set my mind to" mindset until my knee reconstruction 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: especially at that age probably 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: hm interesting 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: and then the rehab really fucked me mentally 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: and it's taken me 10 years to get back to that mindset 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: was 10 years ago your knee? 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: which implies I was probably not mentally healthy for that period 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: ya around 10 years now 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: maybe its been 11 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: eh fuck that guy 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: you dont get to clean up your data by just using a circular definition 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: no true scotsman 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: Knee op was july 2013 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: idk, it feels like it tracks 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: i mean it probably tracks, i just dont like his no true scotsman fallacy 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: like, I wonder what the unintended consequences of a year of excruiciating pain is 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: like rehab was really really painful, the most pain I've ever been in 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: probably gave myself mild PTSD 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: yeah 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: sometimes I think about ash 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: with his broken arm 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: and then I think, im never going to do [brazilian jiu jitsu] with a 17 year old 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: but also I remmeber how much it fucked with him, and how much it must have fucked with him to not be able to go gym and workout 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: so I think theres a level of risk aversion that creeps in there 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: and that probably has other knock on effects 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: we think about the mind as a seperate place to the brain 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: but reality is that its just chemicals, and so an acquired risk aversion is some change in your brain chemisty 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: so theres some amount of cortisol that helps you wake up and go about your day 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: but then a little bit too much gives you diarrhoea and makes you want to avoid certain situations 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: and then too much for too long and you eventually forget your wifes name 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: yeah would be hard to remmeber much if you had diarrhoea for any serious length of time 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: [censored url] 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: Reacted ð to your message  
[2023-01-16] Vanja: this is pretty interesting 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: 60s were wild lol 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: but also 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: any liberation effort eventually turns into a set of rules to follow 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: kinda like our discussion yesterday, theres only conservatism 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: just funny [censored], literally get [censored] but not wanting to be too rude 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: explains cults 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: and how if youâre not looking out for your interests first, judging societal contracts from the lens of âis this right for me?â youâll end up in stupid situations 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: I think you'll find everyone is vulnerable to social pressure but just on different dimensions 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: yeah everyone vulnerable to differing extents 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: men get talked into dumb shit all the time 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: im sure theres [censored] 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: thereâs a sad meme that does the rounds occasionally 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: where some girl will same something like â[censored]" 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: or something like that with different words similar intention 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: [censored url] 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: AI actually seems to be accelerating 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: I feel like we're approaching a singularity 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: whys this special 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: getting ai to generate text on an image was a problem fir a while 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: oh right yeah text was hard 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: sigh stalled on something at work cbf dealing with other peopleâs shit code 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: [censored url] 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: chatgpt but for video 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: thats actually a brilliant usecase 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: show me every closeup shot of a foot kicking a ball 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: and then turn that into a lesson 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: gold rush for sure, but i feel more uselss 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: wdym? 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: what do you use for paper notes? 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: I need a new notebook 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: I have 4 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: I have a nice moleskin notebook, nice leather cover, quite beautiful 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: I never write in it, because nothing I have to write is worthy of it 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: undefined 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: instead I use it as a coaster 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: haha 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: yeah I use those but they're $35 each here 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: I think I paid $10, still too much 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: and I go through 1 a quarter so thats a bit much of an expense 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: undefined 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: also, I dont like that they're hard to shred 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: got this thick paper one I use for drawing donât use* 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: undefined 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: those suck 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: got this nice thick little black one I bought for lyrics. also donât use. I had it with me when I was in miami and I think it did the job of getting the waitress interested 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: lol 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: I guess I'll stick with moleskine 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: undefined 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: and then I use this 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: if youâre thinking âwow, this diagram looks spastic" 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: yes 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: I wasn't going to say anything 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: I had to draw it out, I couldnât understand why I couldnât understand what was going on 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: I'm weighing up the decision of contributing $100 to my boss' leaving gift 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: ugh thats annoying 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: his EA started a chat, and it descended into silly really quickly 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: she was like, looking for gift ideas, let me know privately if you dont want to contribute 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: then people start saying "I'm in" in the chat 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: and then someone suggested we all contribute $100 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: I haven't said anything yet 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: I'm just going to hold out and then beat them all by sending them a picture of him on the jetski I got him 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: like she created a new chat and added you in it? 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: bit annoying 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: but I probably wouldnât rock the boat 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: maybe just ignore it, make her reach out 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: I just dont understand the rationale of contributing a $100 each towards a gift that is definitely going to miss the mark 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: I donât understand adding a new person to the pool 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: I think its just like a, well dont want to leave him out thing 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: pretty wild that one day youâll be able to have a conversation with your journal 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: this was magic in harry potter <20 years ago 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: magic is just poorly explained science 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: thereâs an emotional difference between magic and future tech that Iâm referring to 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: but yeah magic is just poorly explained science 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: whats that? 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: magic more emotion based, tech more cerebral based 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: for you? 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: chatgpt.jpg 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: what did chatbot say? 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: undefined 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: thats kinda what I expected 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: had another one, but I was worried I was leading the question 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: undefined 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: undefined 
[2023-01-16] Dimitar: yeah I wonder how much is influenced by whether you read harry potter as a kid or Dune 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: havenât read dune, but guess who has 
[2023-01-16] Vanja: undefined

[2023-01-17] Dimitar: working east coast time has its drawbacks 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: woke up nice and early for my first meeting 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: cancelled 5mins before 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: I get the adrenaline rush from that, then after a canceled meeting I just boycot all work 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: not really on purpose 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: just hard to realign 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: its ok, turns out I was invited to 3 other meetings so I just joined one at random 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: wyd 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: undefined 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: went with my building friend, the young dude who works at tazer company 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: he showed me their stuff 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: working in big tech is such garbage 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: I used to wonder why cobol programmers didnt move on from cobol 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: now I realise it 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: why, whats their stack look like? 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: I donât think its particularly magic, he showed me some kubernetes dashboard tool and their scala code + github 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: its just, not cobol 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: wyd 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: just getting my day going 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: I have a bunch of 1:1s today 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: lol 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: I was just about to make a tweet about design 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: rofl: https://twitter.com/bertkreischer/status/1615006403474911233 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: what will it say? 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: heres one that chatgpt wrote for you: "Designing software that's easy to use is like magic - it's all about making the complex disappear. #designsimplicity #softwaredesign" 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: lol 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: undefined 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: re-stumbled on to the term scissor-statement 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: undefined 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: I was going to make a cross post on your oat post about sensible defaults in design but then I realised it doesnât really fit with my post 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: this tweet is going to do wonders for your career apparently 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: so I just insulted you isntead

[2023-01-17] Dimitar: with too many teeth 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: lol 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: I'm trying to find this 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: WHERE IS THE INSULT 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: I joined a few meetings this morning just to observe 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: got introduced, said hello etc. 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: at the end of each meeting, "anything else?" 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: some person says oh me and then proceeds to talk for 10 minutes while everyone makes confused looking faces 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: i thought i posted saying terrible default but idk 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: [censored url] 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: i cant tell if this is a troll 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: wat 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: obviously its a troll 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: I donât get it 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: I misread âsun disappearsâ as âtheres less sunlight' 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: âsun is darkâ is a weird phrase 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: I donât get the reference behind this xkdc 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: rofl 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: I'm guessing its a play on the suns energy cycle 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: web store idea: a place where you go to buy stickers for your laptop that represent your interests or whatever 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: [censored url] 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: lol theyre gonna make a 3d printed computer out of this scissor thing soon 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: weird, me and aidan were just talking about making a roomba but for painting 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: we decided using a scissor arm was the way to go 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: roomba for painting? 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: painting walls 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: just set it up in a house and then leave 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: initially itll just do single colors 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: but v2 will mean you come home to the sistine chapel 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: shit is about to get real: https://twitter.com/satyanadella/status/1615156218838003712?s=20 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: yeah pretty neat, I think for my next project Iâll set up something automated that works with gpt 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: I think once I have the basics in place ill be much more likely to follow through with ideas like âapp that scans internet daily for a topic then auto generates a blog about that topic" 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: why wouldnt you just build that thing? 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: feel like that concept, applied repeatedly with a random word generator for topic, might eventually lead to finding a topic 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: that seems super simple? 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: yes i could build something much more complicatd, but my attention span is low and my interests are varied 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: so i need very small chunks of work and to build on them incrementally 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: I feel like you could build what you're describing in 30minutes 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: i also have my bullet notes journal with like 3+ years of private tweets, wondered if i can grab 5 ideas at random then plumb them into chatgpt to see if tcan make a cool blog post 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: i dont think i could 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: its literally crawl a link and then send it to chatgpt 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: then ask chatgpt to write a blog posts about what it summarized 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: which link are you crawling? 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: literally any link 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: grab the morning brew 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: im not saying plagarise someones site via chatgpt 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: im saying automate the process of researching stuff and building websites on that topic 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: part of the work is finding the distinction between those two things 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: yeah different ways to say tomato 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: and iterating on the idea until its good 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: tomayto tomahto 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: right but you could build a thing that takes in a set of links and then produces a blog post on that 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: yeah then youâre just building a few crawlers that work on different links and experimenting wtih the gpt prompt to combine those things 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: its not a huge job, could get something neato out in a weekend 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: but i couldnt do it in 30 mins 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: I think if you had everything configured the code would be 30mins or less 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: wym have everythign configured 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: i have 0 configured 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: like azure setup 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: going frmo 0 to something 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: thats the task 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: so that next time i can say âok i have everything configured i just want to add this little feature" 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: I thought you alraedy had an azure account going? 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: one time months ago i made an azure account that clumsily hosted a react client only page 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: no idea where that account is, doesnt run any server side stuff 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: and I do remember that taking surprisingly long time to get up and running 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: fair enough 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: as opposed to not fair enough? 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: yes 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: I'm not going to argue with someone that a simple thing is simple 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: if you believe its complicated and going to take you more than 30mins then it probably is and will 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: Good, because the discussion was never me saying it was complicated. I agreed way above it was simple 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: chatgpt agrees 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: what did you put in? 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: why is vanja gay 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: lol 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: I just copy and pasted the chat 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: and then asked if vanja thinks its complicated 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: It's not explicitly stated in the conversation whether Vanja thinks the project is simple or not, but from the context of the conversation, it seems that Vanja does not think the project is overly simple. They mention that it's not a huge job but also not something that could be done in 30 minutes, and that part of the work is finding the distinction between researching and plagiarizing. They also mention that they have to go from 0 to something, which implies that they have to start from scratch and set up everything, which is usually not simple. They also mention that building a few crawlers that work on different links and experimenting with the GPT prompt to combine those things is not simple. 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: seems like leading, i said yes right here 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: undefined 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: sorry I actually aked it 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: does vanja think it is simple? 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: undefined 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: undefined 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: sometimes i write things for gpt and i think how could it possibly figure out all the indirectness in this 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: and then it kinda does 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: undefined 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: undefined 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: Convinced it to give feedback in the form of different schools of psychology, then invented a scale and asked for ratings 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: theres so much that can be done with this, we're barely scratching the surface 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: I saw a guy started journaling into chat gpt, and he does it as a conversation with GPT acting as Socrates 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: you can basically have conversations with dead people. now I need to journal all day to record myself into the cloud 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: ok now I got it to rate a bunch of potential responses on a bunch of attributes 1-10, then asked for a response with specific ratings 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: undefined 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: undefined 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: ahah awesome 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: we should just quit our jobs and make meta ai stories 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: meta ai? 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: if there was a good time to quit a job and focus on exploration, now is a pretty decent time 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: you know, the journey of interacting with and learning about Ai 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: ah right 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: yeah should blog about my adventures more 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: feels like a chicken egg situation. if you hit gold you want to have blogged about it, if youre lost in crap then blogging probably slows you down 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: Crap for you is gold for someone else 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: yeah could be, not guaranteed, and not guaranteed theyd find it 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: Thereâs also that thing around when you understand a thing it feels obvious and not worth talking about 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: But to someone who doesnât understand it, itâs novel and amazing 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: [censored url] 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: this is a good one 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: 21 jump street? 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: oh no wait 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: never been kissed 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: apprently a movie 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: yeah 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: this girl posts good moral scissor statements 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: never been kissed 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: whats a scissor stataement? 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: This is good 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: [censored url] 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: statements that find boundaries that divide people 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: intersections of key concepts 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: ill give it s listen next time i gym 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: Oh like âwould you rather?â Questions 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: smart snd funny is a good mix 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: Turns out huberman was a deadbeat in high school and nearly didnât go to college 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: sometimes engineered in a would you rather format 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: Which is surprising 
[2023-01-17] Vanja: whydidnt he slmost go 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: [censored url] 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: He explains it 
[2023-01-17] Dimitar: Here 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: new macbooks 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: I wonder if I can return mine 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: I did not understand that guitar youtube 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: yeah i figured new macbooks came out because this morning I liked my laptop a little less 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: just had a 2 hour code review of all the new shit I was pushing. went well, mostly piddly comments and im aligning more with work jimmy. He didnt really care for âvarâ but we got past that, and he liked a lot of hte other changes I was doing so its good 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: lol 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: Var? 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: guitar video I liked the way he talked about pulling âwordsâ out of âparagraphsâ of music. ie what are the little movement bundles that you can do, collect your favourite ones, then learn to them starting on different parts of the rhythm and in different rhythms 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: That guy is on a level im not at yet 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: He mentioned this one thing like 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: Iâm just on this Dorian D 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: undefined 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: i still dont entirely understand why modes exist, im not there yet 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: lol 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: i think hes describing how to think in the next level, and thats how you get to the next level 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: i watched this other video which was actually very illuminating 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: [censored url] 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: totally changed how I learn scales. the tldr is learn the intervals (ie what shape is it to go from 1 to 3?) and then youâll always know that if youâre at 1 you can get to 3 by doing that, no matter where you are on the guitar 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: so when you learn a new scale you dont have to learn a shape, you just have to know âthis scale is 1 2 3 5 7" 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: and you already know how to get 1->2 1->3 2->3 etc 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: and its not a lot of work 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: ah yeah, I think I've seen this already 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: I already told mum youâre getting the guitar 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: you could coordinate with her if youâre keen 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: but it still relies on knowing all of the intervals and the position of all the notes 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: oh nice, thanks 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: its taken me about 1.5 days of little effort to learn 70% of the pentatonic scale 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: presumably it gets easier as youâve done more 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: the challenging piece is memorizing where the notes are though 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: pentatonic scale intervals i mean 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: you still need to know the root note 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: yeah but you only need to learn 1, then you can get around with intervals 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: eventually youâl learn more 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: from there, whether its c d e f g or 1 2 3 4 5 its the same 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: its just a little bit of syntactic sugar 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: its like knowing that if youâre at C starting note, to get to E you can go interval 3 down or interval 3 right 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: if you really needed to know the note name, the point is you dont need them to start, just the numbered intervals 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: yes but you still need to know the position of the root note lol 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: theres fundamentally no way around taht 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: you only need to know 1 note total on the fretboard 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: you can surely learn one note 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: to get started 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: yes 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: but then once you have c down 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: you need D 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: or F# 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: why? 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: are you going to be playing C your whole life? 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: and again, you dont need to because you can calculate it quicky 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: because you jump around in intervals 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: once youâre at the other interval 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: I dont see how you dont understand this is knowing every note? 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: just because you give it a number and use math to get there 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: doesnt make it any less "knowing where every note is" 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: and the hard part isnt, knowing how to use the math 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: its being able to do it quickly and effectively 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: i did a video but now i see you kind of already responded 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: idk, before finding a note like F was impossible to me and it meant i had to stare at the fretboard 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: now i can kinda do it but just using the equivalent of keyboard shortcuts to get around 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: undefined 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: is it as quick as jumping straight to F? no, calculating C + 7 or whatever is more 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: but this is workable, and from here it improves slowly until you learn more 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: the old task was âmemorize the fretboardâ which was completely not doable for me 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: and now im at something that I can kinda do 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: right 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: I kinda just took for granted that the best way to memorize the fretboard wasnt to remember the position of every note 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: same with piano 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: you dont remember where the keys are 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: and the scales 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: you just remember the whole and half steps for a major and minor scale 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: yeah i didnt do that 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: i learned all the scales rote 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: ouch 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: i was waking up 7am every morning practicing all the scales, then visualizing them at night 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: now i cant remmeber them, but it seemed important at the time 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: im sure my fingers still know 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: if you already know how to find notes by interval on guitar then whats the problem? 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: ^ 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: how quickly do you need it? 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: feels like with intervals you can get around basically instantly 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: you can get a note instantly, and a specific fret/note in like 4-5 hops 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: like instantly 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: as fast as the metronome is going 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: and not only that but transition from one scale to the next to the next and then back to the beginning 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: in what situation do you need to find a note from 0 as fast as a metronome? in what situation do you need to change scales so fast? 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: the hard part is you need to be playing and then mathing the next 3-4 notes in the tune 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: youâre not mathing when youâre playing though 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: wdym? in the playing music situation 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: why not? 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: when are you mathing? 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: you rarely change scales in a song, and you can get very far never changing mid song 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: maybe you mean changing shape 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: hmm, I think I mean scales 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: why are you changing scales 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: so if the chord being played is A 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: maybe I mean shape actually 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: i think this is mode 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: but basically, you want to be on the right part of the scale for the chord being played 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: but if you're on A - C - G 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: then you're playing the scale which contains notes of an A chord 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: then you switch to the part of teh scale which contains c chord notes 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: then G chord notes 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: right so youâll know âthis is the 1 chordâ so youâll know to be on the 1 note area 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: at which point youâll know how to hit the 1 3 5 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: which is hte chord 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: or 1 3b 5 which is the minor 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: add a 7 maybe 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: yeah but you also want to use notes around the scale too 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: maybe a 6 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: yeah you can add those if you want 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: whatever right? 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: and then before you know it C is coming 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: youâll know âi want a 6â and youâll be able to find a 6 because youâre on teh 1 and 1->6 is a known interval 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: and you need to be on a C when the C chord comes 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: yes 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: I understand that 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: then you know how to switch to the next chord (a 5 lets say) by going 1->5 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: you're focusing on the how to do the math 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: that part is straight forward 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: whats the hard part 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: I'm saying the hard part is doing the math while you're playing 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: quickly and effectively 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: yeah and im pretty sure thats quick and effective because youâre not going â5 - 1 = 4 use the 4â or something 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: it bcomes âwhen im on the 2 root, i can mash these finger patterns to stay in the chord" 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: the math is to get around, once you find your place youâre doing finger patterns 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: yeah if you find that quick and effective then you'll be great at improv on guitar 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: thats nice for you 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: thats hard for me 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: finger patterns? 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: knowing which finger patterns to pull at the right time 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: im just trying to highlight that knowing which finger patterns to do is a separate problem from moving to the right area of the fretboard, relocating is a math problem, intervals and sounds is the finger patterns 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: and im not proposing any math inside finger patterns 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: but ill play with it more 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: and see if it ends up being right 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: wyd tonight? 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: not much, got distracted and forgot my afternoon coffee, so very little 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: [censored url] 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: rofl 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: I've never heard the term cottaging before 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: i guess you and ur friends use le bumsex 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: [censored url] 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: Only when weâre talking about your hobbies 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: I wonder how long before code is gone 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: Like thereâs no reason to print code, you could just hide that and make a box called âsearch componentâ 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: the premise ive seen is âit takes a long time to create the right thing, its much quicker to validate that it is the right thing / not incorrectâ 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: so it can generate mildly wrong things quickly that you have to manually verify 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: so dont see how they get rid of code 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: You missed a video call with Dimitar. 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: You think itâs going to generate mildly wrong code forever? 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: You donât see how some things itâs just going to be able to generate confidently and so it just shows a box? 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: Like not even in 10000 years? 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: yeah im not thinking ok the order of 100k years 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: im thinking on the order of my professional life time 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: or really the recent future 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: Like they went from âhereâs some ai that drops in code that looks like the code youâre typingâ 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: To âtell us the code you want and weâll drop it in for youâ 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: In like a year 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: yeah exponential is fast 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: But you donât think theyâll ever replace the code 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: ? 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: Like someone wonât make an ide thatâs right for the simple stuff most of the time 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: ? 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: i dont feel like human judgement gets pushed out of the â° 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: Ok but thatâs a different topic 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: im sure youll have an idea thats drag and drop equiv of llms 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: they already have drag and drop no code 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: You donât sit there and check the byte code or assembly it generates 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: obv the topic isnt can tou make apps with no code 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: because that exists already 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: the qudstion is about regular dev ides 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: going no code view llm 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: i dont, but someone does 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: people look at the generated byte code in depth 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: Yeah itâs a rare operation in regular programming tho 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: and run static analysis proofs to say it will be correct 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: Most people trust the compiler 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: i mean people who do that layer do it 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: i trust the compiler because someone else made it trustable 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: by thinking through the cases with pseudo proofs 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: Yeahâ¦ interesting how that happens 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: llms so far is just pour in data and pray 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: Right now the AI isnât really trustworthy 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: maybe theyll figure out correctness soon 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: or maybe they wont idk, mixed opinions by people in the field 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: but its a new feature, not just lets crank up the data or parameters 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: Well thatâs a turn around from your previous statement of âI donât see how they get rid of codeâ 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: yeah i dont see how they add correctness 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: seems to be the agi problem 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: You probably would have said the same thing about compilers I guess 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: which people are confused about 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: what thing? 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: This thing 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: to compilers? i know how to add correctness to compilers 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: Iâm saying when compilers weâre new you would have been like, how could anyone trust those, theyâll never be able to prove correctness 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: Anyway back to my punch cards 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: yeah i dont think so, mathematical proofs of languages were around before compilers 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: plus with static ttpe systems the problem space is constrained and derministic 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: Canât run a mathematical proof of an ai? 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: llms are nondererministic precitive models by design 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: you can mathematically prove that an LLM is not sound, its guaranteed to give bad results 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: maybe theyll add a layer on top of llm 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: to make it provably correct 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: they havent solved that problem 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: and its an open ended puzzle 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: you can keep tacking on sticky tape like âall code output by llm must be tested in compiler before giving to userâ 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: and you do enough of those hacks itll probably be dev quality eventually 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: not amazing dev, but get shit done dev 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: anywya 2am 
[2023-01-18] Vanja: nite 
[2023-01-18] Dimitar: Nite 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: Was thinking more about probabilistic models today 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: Basically humans write code with some probability of getting it right 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: AI does the same thing except with a lower degree of correctedness and certainty 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: I was also thinking how thereâs a cross multiplication effect once AI systems start talking to eachother 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: Sure the AI that generates the code might be wrong most of the time and need intervention 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: But itâs easy to imagine having an AI that ingests all the interventions that happen with  prompts and the code it generates, and then having it intervene for you 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: Then you have an AI to validate that AI until you land on a correct solution. 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: Basically a neural net where each node is a model 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: I feel like something like that would grow to be capable extremely quickly given the right amount of compute 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: Abstracting LLMs and regular devs to âThey both make code that is sometimes rightâ hides an important difference between the two 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: I saw a twitter post that I think explains it will, recreated here: 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: undefined 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: The part of the Intelligence that doesnât get stuck in cargo culting and says âno, i understand that these things seem correlated on paper, but theyre definitely not connectedâ is missing, so it cant deduce things like e=mc^2 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: something to do with reasoning 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: yeah, I'm not suggesting that the current state of AI replaces devs 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: I'm suggesting the current state of AI replaces writing boilerplate code 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: I mean, I think eventually reasoning gets replaced by AI but I'm not confident on a timeframe there 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: but for things like, make a search box that looks for data X 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: will eventually be the same as pulling in a dependency 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: yeah probably Excel programming and VisualBasic programming get a huge boost 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: imagine the double click a button style programming and then you type in english what it should do 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: or video games is probbaly a big one 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: i had an idea 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: a thing that git commits your changes every second, so you get to see what youâre workign on like a video playback 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: then gpt just looks at your commits for a period and summarises them 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: makes a big branch / commit summary 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: so you can go back in time via summary, find something, and watch it live being written 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: maybe you write a big comment live as you write it âfuck shouldnt have done it like that, undo!â 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: you do live creating, gpt converts it into stories to publish 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: yeah that sounds interesting 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: [censored url] 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: lel 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: looking fwd to ending this crunch period and working on these hacky little ideas 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: will it ever end? 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: well itll end for me when I go to australia 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: actually a perfect way to go from key person to someone whos just overseeing 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: saw some socio on clueless action at work today 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: wow, nsfw 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: what happened? 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: we have an l7 whos overseeing migration correctness project ever since we had that big mess up earlier this year 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: aloke is clearly worried that if theres another fuck up with data on migration its going to get him managed out 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: and weâre running a little hot for our next deadline 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: so now we had a slip up by an sde1/2 who missed validating header respons consistency, and aloke is drumming that up as oh no ive lost confidence in this we cant start our LA until this is good 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: and then hes saying he needs the L7 to sign off on data validation 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: basically shuffling potential risk of things being bad on this guy, and shuffling the blame of delayed project 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: maybe shuffling is the wrong word, hedging 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: blurring the arrow that shows whos responsible 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: I feel like thats just office politics 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: is that what clueless on socio looks like? 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: and its interesting because I remember a few months ago when that L7 and another guy whos trying to make L7 got assigned to that work item, i remember thinking how its a good move for them to be able to show their influence 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: socio on clueless, and socio/clueless/loser is terms of office politics 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: its like saying i watched the defender tackle the attacker 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: and then saying âoh thats just football" 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: wel yeah, its football 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: yeah I never really thought of it that way 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: you thought it was some thing outside of office politis? 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: I thought it was labels on specific types of interactions 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: or labels on specific kinds of people 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: but yeah, makes sense 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: yeah i guess it lives outside of politics as well 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: and its a bit weird to call a guy walking down the street a defender 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: I guess I never picked that behaviour as part of the S/C/L dynamic since I feel like its something that people across those categories do 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: like that just seemed like a common tactic at amazon and it didnt define you as S/C/L 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: yeah but how much of that is because amazon interview process selects for people who politic 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: if youâre not trying to politic your way to the top, and youâre more interested in painting youâll probably avoid amazon and go for the secretary at paper company job 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: sure but what I'm saying is that I've seen clueless and loser try and do the shift blame thing you're describing 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: I always saw the clueless/loser/socio thing as 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: clueless is the company values are meaningful and if I work hard and follow the rules then I'll do well and succeed 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: where as loser was like, yeah idgaf about any of that I'm just here for a paycheck 
[2023-01-19] Dimitar: and socio is, theres a game under the game 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: yeah that fits 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: i dont think anyone is pure s/c/l 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: even plebs can figure out the occasional game, like remember the Jim âwill he wont he become a socioâ thing 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: and losers as socios in sleeping 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: i think you summed it up 
[2023-01-19] Vanja: theres people who play the game, peopel who are oblivious to the game, and people who abstain from the game 
[2023-01-20] Vanja: been getting charged like $70 a month for my azure thing for like 5 months 
[2023-01-20] Dimitar: lol 
[2023-01-20] Dimitar: how?? 
[2023-01-20] Dimitar: just left it running? 
[2023-01-20] Vanja: eh just dumb, did a retro 
[2023-01-20] Vanja: 2 mistakes 
[2023-01-20] Vanja: 1) a react app is a static page, i should have just built and deployed the html somewhere instead of trying to use app service
